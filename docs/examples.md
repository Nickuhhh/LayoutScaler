# Examples
LayoutUtil was designed for easy use with no worries. All you have to do is require the module and construct the class with the desired UILayout as a parameter. There are more advanced features available which are listed within the API if necessary.

```lua
local layout: LayoutUtil.List = LayoutUtil.new(script.Parent.ScrollingFrame.UIListLayout) -- could be a ScrollingFrame or UIListLayout
```
